## 📊 Understanding Load Shedding Stages

Load shedding stages are cumulative:

- **Stage 1:** 1,000 MW shed - least amount of outages
- **Stage 2:** 2,000 MW shed - includes Stage 1 times
- **Stage 3:** 3,000 MW shed - includes Stage 1 & 2 times
- **Stage 4:** 4,000 MW shed - includes all previous stages
- **Stage 5:** 5,000 MW shed - more frequent outages
- **Stage 6:** 6,000 MW shed - maximum frequency
- **Stage 7-8:** Emergency measures with extended outages

**Important:** Higher stages include all lower stage times, meaning more frequent power cuts.

## 💡 Tips for Managing Load Shedding

### Preparation:
