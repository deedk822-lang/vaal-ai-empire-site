## 🎯 How Agents Use This Data

### **Financial Sentinel Agent**
```javascript
// Load SARS data
const section12h = require('./data/sars/section_12h_learnerships.json');
const eti = require('./data/sars/eti_employment_incentive.json');

// Calculate real tax recovery
function calculateTaxRecovery(company) {
  const learners = company.learnerships_completed;
  const recovery = learners.map(learner => {
    const level = learner.nqf_level <= 6 ? 'nqf_1_to_6' : 'nqf_7_to_10';
    const ability = learner.disabled ? 'disability' : 'able_bodied';
    return section12h.allowances.annual_allowance[level][ability];
  }).reduce((sum, amt) => sum + amt, 0);
  
  return {
    amount: recovery,
    source: section12h.official_sources[0],
    confidence: 'Verified by SARS'
  };
}
```

### **Guardian Engine Agent**
```javascript
// Load crisis data
const loadshedding = require('./data/crisis/loadshedding_2024.json');

// Predict crisis
function checkLoadsheddingRisk(eskomData) {
  const eaf = eskomData.energy_availability_factor;
  const indicators = loadshedding.predictive_indicators;
  
  if (eaf < 60) {
    return {
      risk: 'HIGH',
      alert: 'Stage 2-4 loadshedding within 48 hours',
      action: 'Activate backup generators immediately',
      source: loadshedding.data_sources[0]
    };
  }
}
```
